Introduction

The digital transformation of physical spaces has become essential in providing seamless and
personalized experiences to consumers. In line with this vision, the MallMate is a user-
centric, innovative platform designed to enhance convenience, engagement, and efficiency
for mall visitors. The website integrates three primary modules: an Interactive Floor
Planner, a Food Ordering System, and an Advanced Parking System, each tailored to
simplify and elevate the mall-going experience.

1. Interactive Floor Planner
Navigating large commercial malls can be a daunting task for visitors. The Interactive Floor
Planner serves as a real-time, user-friendly digital map of the mall.

Key Features:
 Interactive Navigation: Users can view the layout of each floor and easily locate
shops, restaurants, restrooms, elevators and other facilities.
 Search & Filter: Visitors can search for specific brands or filter shops by category
(e.g., fashion, electronics, lifestyle).
 Store Details: Clicking on a shop icon displays details such as the store’s name,
category, offers, and floor location.
 Accessibility Layer: Highlights ramps, lifts, and other features for visitors with
special needs.

Benefits:
 Saves time by reducing the need for physical directories or mall staff assistance.
 Improves customer satisfaction through enhanced spatial awareness and ease of
movement.
 Encourages store discovery, promoting smaller outlets alongside major brands.


3. Integrated Food Ordering System
The Food Ordering System allows mall visitors to browse menus, place orders, and even
schedule food pickups or deliveries within the mall premises.

Key Features:
 Multi-Restaurant Access: Users can view menus from all participating food outlets
and compare prices and cuisines.
 In-Mall Delivery or Pickup: Orders can be delivered to a specific seating zone or
picked up at the counter, reducing queue times.

cashless transactions.

4. Advanced Parking System
Finding parking in busy malls can be frustrating. The Advanced Parking System introduces a
smart solution to ensure a stress-free entry and exit experience.

Key Features:
 Live Slot Availability: Real-time updates on vacant parking spots via sensors and
digital displays.

website.
